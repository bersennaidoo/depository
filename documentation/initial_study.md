      sell, select some to purchase, and supply the information needed to
      create an order.

        - Example seller scenario : Jon a customer of depository wants to buy a book
          about docker technology to expand is knowledge on docker. So jon first
          browses depository's site for books on docker, then selects a docker
          book that meets is criteria, and then provides details to create
          his purchase order.

    - The seller uses depository to maintain a list of products to sell,
      to determine the orders that are awaiting shippment, and to mark orders
      as shipped.

        - Example seller scenario: Alice the owner of depository uses depository
          application to maintain a list of products, eg: technoloy books to sell,
          she also uses depository to keep track of her orders awaiting shippment,
